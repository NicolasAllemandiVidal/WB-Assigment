            <h4>Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing company.</h4>
            <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property
                to
                the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify
                who
                will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their
                website,
                paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with
                Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities the company
                offers.
                <br> <span> Here is how:</span>

                        <h4>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h4>
                        <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time
                            online,
                            and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                            services
                            are
                            able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and
                            YouTube
                            that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized
                            and
                            targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market
                            for a
                            property such as yours.</p>

                        <h4>Expert Content Production</h4>
                        <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your
                            property.
                            Being
                            able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that
                            elevates
                            the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According
                            to a
                            recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
                            video—and
                            for
                            good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper
                            level
                            and
                            build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing
                            viewers
                            what
                            it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more
                            difficult
                            to do with a written description.</p>
                        <p>However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be
                            described
                            in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
                            created to
                            sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate
                            copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your
                            property
                            attractive to potential buyers.</p>

                        <h4>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h4>
                        <p>Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet.
                            Many
                            of
                            them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search
                            that
                            way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to
                            use
                            the
                            right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as
                            search
                            engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms
                            is a
                            bit
                            of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential
                            buyer
                            searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide
                            opportunities for the buyer to learn more.</p>

                        <h4>Social Media Marketing</h4>
                        <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands
                            of
                            niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs
                            to
                            dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury
                            real
                            estate
                            marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent
                            spent
                            his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media
                            presence? At
                            Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to
                            help
                            them
                            go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of
                            becoming
                            an
                            influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than
                            their
                            competitors.</p>

                        <p>Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an agent doesn’t have a
                            responsive,
                            user-friendly website that is easy to navigate and provides an immersive experience for
                            viewers
                            who
                            want to look at properties, they’ve already lost their advantage. Those agents who work with
                            Luxury
                            Presence have websites that are designed and managed by seasoned professionals who know what
                            property buyers want. Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour integration, HD
                            video

                            dashboard to help them easily utilize their site and maximize its potential. An agent who is
                            backed
                            by a powerful website is one who can easily reach a niche audience, streamline the selling
                            process,

                            word-of-mouth marketing is still the best way to sell a property. Agents who work with
